## IMU-Sensor-ID
Posture Classifier – IMU Sensor Posture ID

• Collected real time data (> 1.4k points) for training of RNN in the interpretation of sequential data from IMU sensor positioning & accelerometer readings (TensorFlow).

• Trained on processed data from real time data collection from IMU sensor on Arduino Nano33. Added random noise for real world variation from 'perfect' sensor data.

• Tested, validated, & deployed a Recurrent Neural Network trained for the real time ID of posture with data from IMU sensor (Arduino Nano33).
